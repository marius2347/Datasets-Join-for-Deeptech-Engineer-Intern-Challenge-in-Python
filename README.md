<h1> Datasets Join (Deeptech Engineer Intern Challenge) - Python Project</h1>
<br>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Containing 3 datasets with data about the same companies from 3 different sources</li>
    <li>Facebook (facebook dataset.csv)</li>
    <li>Google (google dataset.csv)</li>
    <li>Company Website (website dataset.csv)</li>
    <li>The final purpose of this exercise is to create a 4th dataset that contains the other 3 and, by joining them, we should reach a better accuracy on common columns</li>
    <li>The columns that interest us the most are Category, Address (country, region...), Phone, Company names</li>
</ul>

<h2>Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Q: What column will you use to join? A: "domain" column as the ID / PRIMARY KEY</li>
    <li>Q: If you have data conflicts once you join, which one do you believe? A: If only one non-NaN value in the category columns, if columns have the same value, returns that value, otherwise having nothing at common, returns NaN</li>
    <li>Q: If you have very similar data, what information will you keep? A: If they share a common word, it returns the first value containing that common word</li>
</ul>
